This article discusses the stereotypes towards our generation, which grew up with technology and social media. The study focused on 55 developers in two different software development firms. It found that both developers averaging age 22 who grew up with social media starting at age 11, and developers averaging age 34 who experienced social media but after their adolescence shared a desire for software to have social impact. This challenges the notion that the young generation has polar opposite views from older generations about software and its stance in the world.

I found it interesting that the "generational divide" on this topic is not so much a generational divide as much as it is an experiential divide. Those who did not grow up with social media at an early age in the young generation did not share the view that software should have social impact, the belief which the other two groups held.
